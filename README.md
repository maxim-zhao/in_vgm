# in_vgm
Winamp plugin for VGM files developed from 2001 to 2009

This repo houses the source for in_vgm, the Winamp plugin I wrote for VGM files as they were being invented. 

It is no longer under development.

Some source is taken from (old) versions of Gens and MAME, and some versions include Winamp API headers. 
All remaining code is mine (with some help from others at times).

The code was originally licenced as follows:

```
You are allowed to do what you like with it just so long as:

1. You let me know if you distribute it (any included files or
   anything derived from them), and
2. You don't pass it off as your own.
```

It is now relicenced under the Unlicense, you are free to do whatever you want with it.

Original releases (for some of which the source snapshot is lost) can be found at http://www.smspower.org/Music/InVgm
