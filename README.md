# in_vgm
Winamp plugin for VGM files developed from 2001 to 2006

This repo houses the source for in_vgm, the Winamp plugin I wrote for VGM files as they were being invented. 

It is no longer under development.

Some source is taken from (old) versions of Gens and MAME, and some versions include Winamp API headers. 
All remaining code is mine (with some help from others at times), and is licenced liberally.
