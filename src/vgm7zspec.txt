* VGM7z format specification
************************************************************************

1. Purpose

There is a desire to be able to transfer entire VGM format soundtracks
in a single file with minimum size. That is what VGM7z is for.

2. Short version

A VGM7z file is a 7-zip archive containing all the files normally found
in a VGM pack, with a different extension.

3. Long version

"MUST" means not to do so will make your VGM7z invalid and software is entitled
(but not obliged) to refuse to handle it. "Should" means you don't have to do
it but I'll be angry if you don't (and software shouldn't be bothered by it).

A VGM7z file is a 7-zip archive using LZMA compression (it MUST be LZMA).
It contains files as specified below. There should not be any additonal files
beyond those listed, nor should there be any "comments" or similar cruft on the
archive. In general, best results will be achieved by using "solid" compression.
The archive MUST not use any password protection or encryption.

All filenames should be stored without any directory/path information. Software
MUST discard any such information if it extracts the files.

- VGM files (at least one required)

  These should be uncompressed (ie. no GZip compression) to allow for better
  overall compression.

  They should be named in the form
  "Game Name - Track Name.vgm"

  Filenames MUST only use regular ASCII characters - no accents.
  Obviously, characters that are disallowed in filenames on common operating
  systems MUST not be used (eg. \/:*?"<>| ).

  The standard of trimming, looping, GD3 tagging, etc is not a matter for this
  document.

- Playlist (required)

  This should be an unextended M3U format playlist. That means a plain text
  file where each line lists one and only one filename, separated by standard
  Windows CRLF line breaks.

  It should contain only the filenames of the files; extended data on lines
  starting with '#' should not be present, and lines containing filenames MUST
  not contain any additional data such as path information or comma-separated
  metadata.

  It should be named in the form
  "Game Name.m3u"

  It MUST contain one entry for each VGM file included in the pack.

- Description text (optional, no more than one)

  This file is optional for VGM7z, but is recommended.

  It should be named in the form
  "Game Name.txt"

- Pack image (optional, no more than one)

  This is an image in PNG or JPG format that represents the game in question.
  It is common practice to use the game's title screen, but a scanned image of
  the game box might be an alternative.

  Regardless of the format, it MUST be named
  "folder.jpg"
  in order to get desirable effects with common software such as Windows
  Explorer. Software can examine the file header to determine the format.

  The dimensions and filesize of the image should be reasonable - eg. original
  1:1 resolution for a game screenshot. Make good use of tools such as PNGOUT
  to optimise the file size.

Future development of the VGM format may lead to the use of additional files
not mentioned in this specification. Obviously, that means that this list is
non-exhaustive.

4. Software usage

There are two obvious approaches to using VGM7z files. The first is to simply
play the files directly from the VGM7z file itself. I do not advocate this
approach (the memory requirements and decompression time are likely to make the
playback process less smooth, especially if playback jumps between packs often)
but you are welcome to use it this way if you want.

The second, recommended way is to use it as a container format for transferring
files. When first opened, the software should extract all of the files to an
appropriate location, along the way compressing all of the VGM files to save
the user's disk space. It should then (optionally) delete the original VGM7z file.

If the software in question is a VGM player, it should use the playlist to
start playing the extracted tracks, and remove any playlist entry for the VGM7z
file.
