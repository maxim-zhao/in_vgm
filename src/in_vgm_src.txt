in_vgm source
=============

This source is for Delphi. I use Delphi 3 normally, but I tried it on Delphi 6 and it required only one change, which I added a conditional define to fix. If you have 4 or 5 the compiler will point you to the change you might need to make.

You are allowed to do what you like with it just so long as:

1. You let me know if you distribute it, and
2. You don't pass it off as your own.
