Game_Music_Emu 0.3.0 MAME YM2612 Emulator
-----------------------------------------
This is a modified version of MAME's YM2612 FM sound chip emulator for use with
Game_Music_Emu, providing better accuracy. It hasn't been tested much and is
about half the speed. It might not be possible to have more than YM2612
emulator at a time (and thus more than one Vgm_Emu at a time).

To use this with Game_Music_Emu, replace the original Ym2612_Emu.cpp with the
one provided.
