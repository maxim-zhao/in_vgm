in_vgm source files
===================

Made with VC6. Please let me know if I've missed out any files. Uses ZLib (not included) and EMU2413 (included).

Please note that I am a C newbie, so there may well be some stupid stuff in this source.

You are allowed to do what you like with it just so long as:

1. You let me know if you distribute it (any included files or anything derived from them), and
2. You don't pass it off as your own.

Automatic Japanese:
