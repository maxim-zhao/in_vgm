in_vgm source files
===================

Made with VC7. Please let me know if I've missed out any files.
Uses ZLib (not included), EMU2413 (included), a modified version
of some MAME FM cores (included), Gens' YM2612 core (included),
Winamp SDK (not included), LZMA SDK (not included), SQLite 
(not included).

Many thanks to BlackAura for getting the MAME stuff working.

Please note that I was not vastly experienced in C when I wrote 
most of this, so there may well be some stupid stuff in this 
source.

You are allowed to do what you like with it just so long as:

1. You let me know if you distribute it (any included files or
   anything derived from them), and
2. You don't pass it off as your own.
